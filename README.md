## About The Project

This project is for a university course, but it also improved our skills and made us more aware of github and Natural Language Processing, which inspired us to put effort into it.

### Course :
Natural Language Processing (CSEN 1076) , Spring 2022.

### Theme :
The goal of the project is to use sentiment analysis to create emotional arcs for movie scripts. The aim is to create a graph based on the script analysis that will define the major arc of the movie storyline.

### Tools and Technologies :
- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web tool that lets data scientists create and share documents with live code, equations, computational output, visualisations, and other multimedia elements, as well as explanatory text. 
- Python: A programming language that is commonly used to create websites and applications, automate operations, and perform data analysis. Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be used to develop a wide range of applications and isn't tailored to any particular problem.
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): A Python toolkit for writing programmes that work with human language data in order to be used in statistical natural language processing (NLP). It includes tokenization, parsing, categorization, stemming, tagging, and semantic reasoning for text processing.
- Matplotlib: One of the most widely used Python packages for data visualisation. It's a cross-platform library that generates 2D charts from array data.
- NumPy: A Python library for manipulating arrays. It also provides functions for working with matrices, fourier transforms, and linear algebra.
